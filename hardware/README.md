# RP2040 Trackball Hardware Design

The design consists of a base, the Trackball case itself, and three roller mounts for the static bearing balls.
Adapt the size settings at the top, if needed, then print all the parts and assemble.

The `external` folder contains two designs just used for visualization purposes.
They are [this Cherry MX switch](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:421524) and this [Pi Pico case](https://www.printables.com/model/210898-raspberry-pi-pico-case).
They are licensed as CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-NC-SA, respectively.
